Prerequisites:
  Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Steps:
1. Clone the Repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_folder>
```
2. Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Create a .env file
Create a .env file in the root of your project to store your secrets.
Add your secret values to the .env file. For example:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
JWT_SECRET=myjwtsecret
```
4. Environment Variable Setup:

Update your application code to use environment variables for sensitive information. For example, if you are using the dotenv library, you can load the environment variables in your main application file:
```
require('dotenv').config();
```

5. Start the Application:

```
npm start
```

6. Access the API:

Your application should be running on http://localhost:<port>. The default port is often 3000. Check your console for the actual port number.
Additional Notes:
Update Database Configuration:

If your application uses a database, ensure that the database configuration in your application code uses the environment variables. For example:
```
const dbConfig = {
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  // other database configuration
};
```
Securing .env File:

Do not commit your .env file to version control systems like Git. Add it to your .gitignore file to prevent accidental commits.
Environment Variable Management:

Consider using a tool like dotenv-safe to ensure that all required environment variables are defined before starting the application.
Security Best Practices:

Regularly review and update your secrets.
Use secure practices for storing and handling sensitive information.
